### Hi guys 👋


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm Steven K Makunzva and I like sharing knowledge and writing code. I also have a blog were I post software development related topics from systems architecture, java programming, algorithms e.tc. https://www.developerssauna.stevekmak.com . I will share the code on some of the articles on this profile but other interesting things like challanges faced, lessons learnt and comments will be on the blog article.
Please feel free to subscribe    🙋 🙋, share 😍, comment 💬 and follow 👩🏼‍💻👨🏼‍💻

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I like reading technology books and also review software development manuscripts for Manning publications 📜. I'm working on becoming an open source contributor and will give more details once I make my first commit 😀

I'm also a co-ordinator of the CapeTown Java Community and do join our group when we schedule online events
